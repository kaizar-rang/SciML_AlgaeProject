**Abstract**

Algal blooms pose a significant ecological and public health threat, characterized by rapid growth of algae in water bodies, often leading to oxygen depletion, toxin production, and disruption of aquatic ecosystems. Traditional models to predict and manage algal blooms are limited by their inability to incorporate complex, nonlinear interactions between biological and environmental factors. This project addresses this gap by leveraging Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) techniques, specifically Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODE) and Universal Differential Equations (UDE), to enhance the prediction and forecasting of algal bloom dynamics.



**Problem Statement and Explanation**

Algal blooms are increasingly frequent and severe, exacerbated by nutrient pollution and climate change. Current models struggle to accurately predict bloom occurrences and their impacts due to the intricate dependencies on nutrient concentrations and environmental conditions. The traditional Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models are often simplistic, lacking the flexibility to capture the nonlinear growth patterns of algal populations.



**Project Objective**

This project aims to develop a sophisticated modeling approach that integrates SciML techniques to improve the understanding and forecasting of algal bloom growth. By starting with a simple algal bloom growth model and progressively incorporating more complex variables such as nutrient concentrations, the project will utilize Neural ODEs and UDEs to predict algal biomass over time. The neural network components within the UDE framework will allow for the inclusion of unknown or complex interaction terms, providing a more accurate and comprehensive model.



**Importance and Benefits**

The improved models will serve as powerful tools for ecologists and environmental managers, enabling better prediction, management, and mitigation of algal blooms. Accurate forecasting of algal blooms can inform timely intervention strategies to prevent ecological damage and protect public health. Additionally, this project showcases the potential of SciML techniques to revolutionize ecological modeling, offering a template for addressing other complex environmental challenges
